        <h3>Windows 8</h3>
        <p>Windows 8 was a failure because the OS wasn't PC & Laptop friendly and more tablet friendly because of it's metro interface 
        and the replacement of it's start menu by a screen which was non-touch friendly at all and the fact that they got rid of the start button in the first iteration
        of the os and only brought back in the 8.1 update which was in my opinion a dumb name and the fact Windows 8 had so many diffrences user chose to stick with 7
        until 10 arrived or install a third party start menu.</p>

       <h3>Apple Vision Pro </h3> 
       <p>The Apple Vision Pro was a flop because of it's low sales figures of one 370,000 units in the first quarters of 2024 and it's price of $3,500/Â£3,500 
        which is more than it's competitors such as the Meta Quest for instance which a lot cheaper than the vision pro and does more things than the vision pro in
        terms of features apple marketed this as a spatial computing with adverts that showed it being immersive than it actually was and failing to resonate with 
        wider audiences. </p>
