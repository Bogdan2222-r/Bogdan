        <h3>Windows 8</h3>
        <p>Windows 8 was a failure because the OS wasn't PC & Laptop friendly and more tablet friendly because of it's metro interface 
        and the replacement of it's start menu by a screen which was non-touch friendly at all and the fact that they got rid of the start button in the first iteration
        of the os and only brought back in the 8.1 update which was in my opinion a dumb name and the fact Windows 8 had so many diffrences user chose to stick with 7
        until 10 arrived or install a third party start menu.</p>
